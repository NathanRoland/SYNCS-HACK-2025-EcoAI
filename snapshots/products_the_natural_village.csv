The Natural Village,Adventure Snacks,2 minutes,https://www.thenaturalvillage.com/product/adventure-snacks/,https://www.thenaturalvillage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Adventure-Snacks-Logo-500x500.jpg,,"Description Our make-at-home mixes are a mile ahead of traditional baking mixes – they’re all natural, organic and contain ingredients which are high in essential nutrients. They’re snacks and treats which are good for you! They are also super convenient, and easy to make. We’ve done the hard work for you. Have some packs in the pantry so you always have what you need on hand to create delicious, nutritious snacks the whole family will enjoy! Here at Adventure Snacks we’re working towards a world where convenient, nutritious food is easily available to everyone. We use high quality organic and natural ingredients to create great tasting products without the junk, and believe this will help inspire our kids to have a life-long love of real food. We only use the types of things you might find in a kitchen cupboard. Nothing strange which sounds like it comes from a laboratory rather than a kitchen, like unnecessary additives and preservatives. And we strive to challenge industry standards. If we can make something tasty that is also good for our bodies, why wouldn’t we? Our kids deserve the best. Apart from making delicious organic snacks, we also aim to inspire and educate both parents and children to make better, more informed food choices. We don’t like misleading packaging, or marketing messages ourselves, so promise to always have clear, honest labelling so you know what is in the food. Isn’t that the way it should be anyway? We want to be part of the change; the movement towards holding big companies responsible and calling them out on their deceitful ways. We’d love for you to join us! We choose to use organic ingredients where possible – not only are they free from synthetic chemicals and pesticides (and higher in nutrition), but organic farming is also better for our environment. The choices we, as a business make, impact the world around us so we want to ensure the impact is a positive one!",
