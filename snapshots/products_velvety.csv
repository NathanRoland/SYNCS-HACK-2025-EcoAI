Inhale the perfume of the creamy bubbles to refresh the senses! This blend is also effective for acne-prone skin. Use it on a soft cotton face washer to gently cleanse your face once or twice a week. No plastic bottles! Great for your skin & for the environment! How to use: For the creamiest lather be sure to use a sponge or loofah with your soap. Once or twice a week grab the bar in hand and directly wash all over with it! Thoroughly rinse skin and pat dry. Be sure to leave your bar well drained between use to extend its life.

If your item is heavily soiled, you can rinse with lukewarm water but never fully submerge the product as this may cause irreversible damage. 2 Let your item dry before any application is made and refrain from using a heat source to dry more quickly, as this could cause damage. 3 We recommend using a natural colourless wax for your #MadeFromPiñatex products. Apply a small amount to a dry, soft cloth and rub sparingly over the textile in a circular motion until fully absorbed. Do not use too much wax as it may not fully absorb. 4 Leave your item to dry naturally for 24 hours after application. 5 You can also buff the wax off with a dry cloth or soft brush.

Check. Dirty face? Hell no! A powdered cleanse with potent actives to help improve skin tone, remove dead skin cells, while magically balancing, brightening, and moisturizing skin. Enzymes Help to gently peel dead skin cells, improving skin tone and appearance. Skin type Uneven skin tone, oily, combination, and acne-prone skin. A gentle powder-to-foamy cleanser with natural enzymes from pineapple and Aussie native wild child Pepperberry to help improve skin tone and remove dead skin cells while magically balancing, brightening, and moisturizing skin. Just add water! The Cleanse Dust vegan enzyme powder face cleanser is the MVP of your daily skincare routine. A waterless formula packed with nutrients from shiitake mushroom, Aussie grown Banana, and Pepperberry leaves skin balanced and brighter every day. Its powder form allows you to control the exact type of lather you’d like by adjusting the amount of water added. So those natural enzymes? We thought you’d ask… Pineapple’s active ingredient, bromelain, is an enzyme wizard, helping to reignite cellular turnover and even out your skin tone. Mix in banana, rich in potassium and zinc, to make one helluva fruit salad and keep your complexion healthy AF, all while cleansing, hydrating, purifying, and restoring balance. Why’s it so special? A waterless formula means all its active ingredients remain potent and undiluted. Pepperberry has a long history of medicinal use in Aboriginal culture because of its ridiculously high amounts of antioxidants, vitamins E & A, and rutin; all mega-forces that stimulate collagen production and help soothe, brighten and preserve skin. Cleanse Dust gets a little help from kaolin to detoxify, while banana hydrates, so your skin isn't stripped of its much-needed natural moisture. Tips? For the perfect lather, adjust the amount of Cleanse Dust and water while rubbing your hands together. If you are sensitive to pineapple this product may not be suitable for you. How to use it Shake out a small coin-sized amount of powder into your wet palm and rub your hands together to create a creamy lather.

If your item is heavily soiled, you can rinse with lukewarm water but never fully submerge the product as this may cause irreversible damage. / 2 Let your item dry before any application is made and refrain from using a heat source to dry more quickly, as this could cause damage. / 3 We recommend using a natural colourless wax for your #MadeFromPiñatex products. Apply a small amount to a dry, soft cloth and rub sparingly over the textile in a circular motion until fully absorbed. Do not use too much wax as it may not fully absorb. / 4 Leave your item to dry naturally for 24 hours after application. / 5 You can also buff the wax off with a dry cloth or soft brush.
