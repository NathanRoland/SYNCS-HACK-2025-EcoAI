It is estimated that we release approximately 4kg of microplastics per person per year into the environment via various means. Every time synthetic clothes are washed, countless microfibers are released into the water and make their way into rivers, lakes, and oceans. Once in the environment, they are consumed by aquatic organisms, which can result in gastrointestinal infections and blockages, reproductive problems, and starvation. The tiny plastic fragments threaten our own health too as they enter our diet and our bodies through the food chain. Alarmingly, microplastics are thought to be present in virtually everything we consume. They’ve been detected in human placentas, our bloodstream and our organs. With the GUPPYFRIEND Washing Bag, you can help prevent the release of microplastics into our waterways. The Guppyfriend reduces fibres shedding during washing thereby protecting your clothes, and it reliably filters microplastic fibres out before they pollute water. Why have we selected this product?

The leaves and bark of the plant are used to make an extract that’s been used for centuries as a natural remedy for various skin conditions. It has astringent properties, which can help contract the skin and tighten pores and is also a natural anti-inflammatory, so it help reduce redness and swelling. That’s why I use it for shoo! as it will be gentle on those who suffer from eczema, psoriasis, and other inflammatory skin problems or sensitive skin. If you have sensitive skin, always do a patch test on your inner wrist. Close eyes when spraying on face, if spray gets into eyes, rinse with cool water.",In stock

In the US alone, it has been estimated that more than two billion razor blade heads are thrown into landfill each year. And that stat doesn’t even include the plastic disposable razors. Shaving cartridges are made of a mix of rubber and plastic (some even contain palm oil in the moisturizing strips) making them impossible to recycle and therefore destined for landfill. Don’t forget about the plastic trays they all come packaged in as well. However, you can now put your worries aside as there is an amazing and far less wasteful alternative available here at Little Eco Shop. Introducing these beautifully sleek, modern and durable reusable safety razors from Kappi. Guaranteed to reduce your environmental footprint and provide the smoothest, irritation-free shave of your life. Why have we selected this product? Includes one reusable razor plus 5 replacement blades (approx. 35 shaves) Choice of 3 stunning colours: matte gold, matte rose gold and matte black The most stunning safety razor on the market Unisex razor Blades can be recycled at end of their life 100% plastic-free Enjoy a smooth and irritation-free shave – no more unsightly ingrowns Economical in the long run (see below for more info) Additional blades can be purchased at Little Eco Shop Product Stats: Material: Stainless steel Dimensions / weight: 10.5 cm L Made in: China A few messages from the manufacturer: Included with every razor is a 5-pack of replacement razor blades which should last around 35 shaves (5-7 shaves per blade). Safety Razor vs. Modern Razor - A cost comparison. The cost of our safety razors is truly a reflection of their quality. The genius of modern day shaving companies is that they make a loss on the shaver handle and make a HUGE profit on the replacement blades. So while modern razors blades seem cheap by comparison, over time they end up costing you big time. Compared to modern multi-blade cartridge heads costing around $3 per head, the Kappi safety razor uses traditional double-sided razor blades that only cost around 20-cents - around 15 times cheaper than the modern equivalent. How to use your new Safety Razor: Unpack your safety razor. With dry hands, hold onto either side of the razor head and unscrew the handle anti-clockwise to loosen. The base will disconnect from the head. Once the razor is disassembled, carefully unwrap the blade and place it onto the head of the razor. After the blade is in place, reassemble the razor by screwing the handle clockwise to tighten. Get shaving! For a smooth shave, we recommend soaking your skin with warm water, using a shave cream/gel/oil (or bar of soap) and take it slow! Be especially careful when shaving around ankles, knees etc. Use your razor on an angle (different for different areas) and apply very little to zero pressure. Once the blade begins to dull, replace your blade and put your used blade in a glass jar to store and eventually recycle.",In stock

Where do you start if you want to reduce the plastic in your life? Especially when most of us are wearing it, eating and drinking from it, sitting on it, walking on it, and probably even ingesting it. Anywhere you go, plastic is within easy reach - even in Antarctica and the North Pole. We didn't quit plastic overnight. In fact, it's still a work in progress. But along the way, we have learnt a lot by researching the issue from the grass roots up, speaking to people, and finding out what works and what doesn't. We answer the tricky questions, like 'How will I wash my hair?', 'Do I have to give up crackers?', 'What about my bin liner?' and 'Is this going to be expensive?' As we continue to remove throw-away plastics from our daily lives, we've discovered we're friendlier with our local communities, we're eating healthier food, and de-cluttering happens by itself.

Glass files seal the surface and edges which help to prevent chipping and strengthen nails. Traditional nail files are meant to be disposed of and replaced every 3 months as they cannot be cleaned or sanitised so they collect a buildup of bacteria which can cause infections, weakness and breakage. Not the Buff Wand though!

Sunprints were originally developed as a learning tool by educators at the Lawrence Hall of Science at the University of California. They are perfect for curious kids looking to experiment with some sun-based science or for any age wanting to get in touch with their artistic side. Whether you want to add to your craft equipment, create some artistic pieces for your home or encourage some scientific based learning, Sunprints are the thing for you. They make excellent gifts and in turn can be used to create artistic gifts perfect for doting relatives. They truly are the gift that keeps on giving! How it works: Get your kids (or adults!) to hunt or forage for some fun and interesting shaped objects such as a fern, flower or feather Arrange your objects on a piece of Sunprint paper out of the reach of the sun. Place the acrylic pressing sheet on top to flatten and hold your items to the Sunprint paper Take your Sunprint outside and lay it in direct sunlight for 2-5 minutes. Rinse your Sunprint in water. Watch the white turn into blue and the blue turn into white. To get the deepest blue that the paper can give, leave it in the water for a while: 1-5 minutes. Lay your Sunprint flat on an absorbent surface and allow it to dry. You can use a paper towel or a piece of cardboard as a bed for your Sunprint while it dries. Putting it on something absorbent will help to avoid the formation of water spots by drawing the water away from the Sunprint paper. Admire your beautiful, deep blue Sunprint!

Find tips, strategies, recipes, and DIY projects for reducing waste in this approachable, beautifully designed and illustrated guide. What is zero waste living? Although the practice has been around for generations out of necessity, it is making a comeback as concerns grow about the fate of our environment. To put it simply: it is attempting to send no waste to landfills. Although you may have read or heard about “zero waste,” “sustainable,” or “green” living, the concept can sometimes seem too complicated, the author’s tone a bit self-righteous, or riddled with advice geared for people with 5 acres of land in the country with dreams of raising livestock and homesteading. This is not that book. Can a “regular” person do this? Absolutely! Zero waste isn’t necessarily about zero, but more about changing or altering the way we see the world around us, how we consume, and how we think about waste. It’s about making better choices when we can, and working to reduce our overall impact by reducing the amount of packaging and single-use plastics we bring into our life. An Almost Zero Waste Life will change the way you see the world around you, how you consume, and how you think about waste for a healthier planet and happier you. Why have we selected this product? Focusing on the positive, An Almost Zero Waste Life presents simple ways to reduce waste in every aspect of your life: Cleaning: Recipes for natural cleaners and how to ditch paper towels for good. Meal plans: Weekly menus and recipes for zero waste meals that use bulk pantry staples. Shopping: How to shop zero waste at big chain stores and ways to reduce food packaging. Bathroom: Sustainable beauty routine. Recycling: Ingenious ways to repurpose old clothing and how to recycle small metals, like razor blades. Compost: The basics of composting. And much more.

The OrganiCup reusable menstrual cup provides you with an eco-friendly and economical alternative which is safe, easy to use and reliable. Popularity in the menstrual cup has been growing considerably over recent years. A study conducted on menstrual cup users showed that 91% of participants said they would continue to use a menstrual cup after using it for 3 cycles and said they would recommend it to others. Why have we selected this product?

Every beginning can be difficult – including trying a menstrual cup for the first time. However we can assure you, there’s nothing to fear. Here are five simple steps on how to use a menstrual cup: Sterilize the cup Before the first use, sterilize the cup in boiling water for 3-5 minutes. Fold and insert the folded cup There are many ways to fold the cup, we recommend the Punch Down fold and the C-fold. Once the entire cup is inside of you, simply let it pop open. Check if the cup is unfolded Reach in and feel around the base of the cup – it should feel round or oval and not have any noticeable folds. If you feel any dents, gently grip the base of the cup (not the stem) and rotate it to make it unfold. Remove the menstrual cup Pull slightly on the stem while using your abdominal muscles to push the OrganiCup downwards until you can reach the base. Give the base of the cup a pinch to release the suction and ease it out. Avoid removing your menstrual cup by pulling the stem as this might cause discomfort. Empty and re-insert. It may take you a few days or a few periods to become comfortable with the cup. Experiment with different folding and insertion techniques – and don’t worry, you’ll soon become a dedicated cup convert! Which size menstrual cup is right for you? We’re all built differently – luckily – and that’s why we offer three sizes OrganiCup. We have chosen to distinguish between the two in the following way: Mini – recommended for teens or those who need a smaller size Size A – recommended for those who have not given birth vaginally Size B – recommended for those who have given birth vaginally Some find this overly generalized; some even find it offensive. That’s completely understandable, but as the vagina is 100% unique to the individual, it will never be a ‘one size fits all’ product. You might not notice a difference after having given birth vaginally, but things have changed and your vagina will probably not return completely to its pre-birth shape and that is completely fine! Therefore, we have chosen pre- and post vaginal birth as the primary factor when guiding our customers. We wish to keep it easy for our customers to choose and our research shows it is a physiological factor one needs to consider and that vaginal birth is actually the most decisive factor when you’re choosing cup size. Factors to consider when choosing the right cup size With that said, it doesn’t mean that one who has given birth vaginally can’t use a Size A and that a young user, who hasn’t given birth vaginally, with a heavier flow can’t use a Size B. We do offer a size guarantee, if the size against expectation should be wrong. In fact, most people can use either size OrganiCup and our guideline is not bullet proof so there are a couple of other factors, you might want to consider when you’re choosing the menstrual cup size for you. Regular or heavy flow The OrganiCup can be used for up to 12 hours at the time – also during night – depending on your flow. We recommend that you empty your menstrual cup more frequently in the beginning while you’re getting to know the cup and your flow. If you have a light or regular flow, we recommend the Size A or Size Mini for teens or those who need a smaller size. However, if you have a heavier flow you might want to consider going with the Size B, which has a bigger capacity. Some OrganiCup users like to have both cup sizes, as their flow is heavier in the beginning of their menstrual cycle and therefore prefer the Size B and then switch to the Size A in the end of their cycle where their flow is lighter. First time cup users We recommend the Size Mini or Size A for teens and young cup users. You can actually start using a menstrual cup as soon as you get your period. Although, there is no age limit; it does however require that you are comfortable with your body and period. Mums For the mums, we generally recommend going with a Size B as per the above, however, have you delivered your child/children by C-section, we recommend going with an OrganiCup Size A.",In stock

They provide a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to using plastic bags in your bins as there are no petroleum additives and they will degrade in landfill or the natural environment (should they ever find their way out of landfill or a composting facility). They are also a great way of collecting household organic waste such as vegetable peelings or green waste which can then be composted at home. Home composting is an efficient way to reduce the amount of waste you send to landfill, help reduce methane production in landfill and is also excellent nourishment for your garden. Did you know that by composting, a typical family can reduce more than 300 kilograms of waste each year? Biotuff’s bags are biodegradable and certified compostable in both aerobic industrial and home composting facilities.

The volumes of the bulk food bags vary dependent on what you are putting in them. For example a small bag of flour is going to weigh more than a small bag of corn chips, but to give a rough idea we have modelled the look of our Bulk Food Bags on the classic 1kg and 2kg flour bags with the large being able to carry as much as 5kg. The goal for our reusable bulk bags is to be able help people easily and conveniently transport their bulk food purchases home. The bags have been designed as a lightweight top up tool to replace the need for carrying jars and canisters when doing your shopping, and when you bring them home you should empty the contents into your storage jars and containers. Although made from recycled plastic drink bottles and technically plastic, the rPET material that makes our bags is woven in nature not solid state plastic like a single use plastic bag which is non-permeable for air and water. Because of the woven nature of the fabric, a solid state plastic bag will definitely prevent air from reaching the bulk food products better than our bulk bags will when storing your bulk food products.

Although made from recycled plastic drink bottles and technically plastic, the rPET material that makes our bags is woven in nature not solid state plastic like a single use plastic bread bag which is non-permeable for air and water. Because of the woven nature of the fabric, a solid state plastic bag will definitely prevent air from reaching the loaf better than our bread bags will when storing your bread on the bench top, which is why we mention that bread will only really last 2-3 days on the bench top, and will likely only be suitable for toast after the first 24hrs. As mentioned above however, our bags are Freezer Proof and store your bread really well when frozen from fresh for up to 3 months without freezer burn in a frost free freezer. Using our lunch wraps or even beeswax wraps to wrap around the end of the bread being cut helps cut down on the exposure to air for the bread, but it is important that the bag can breathe too. Again fresh bread from a bakers, which are often preservative free, will only last 2-3 days on the bench top anyway. It is best to freeze sliced bread from fresh if you want your bread to last a week or two. Our bread bags are definitely at their best when used to not only collect your bread from the baker, but also for storing your fresh bakery or home baked sliced bread in the freezer.",Out of stock

Onya’s small reusable bulk food bag provides a convenient alternative to taking jars or containers and they are also super handy for topping up half-filled containers at home as it means you don’t need any extra containers on top of your current ones. Why have we selected this product? Made from 4 BPA free food safe 100% recycled plastic drink bottles 100% recyclable Clear window allows you to see inside and to write product name or code Tare weight is included on the bag 100% vegan friendly 12 month manufacturer’s warranty Product Stats: Material: rPET – made from 4 recycled plastic drink bottles Dimensions / weight: 27cm L x 11cm W with 6.5cm gusset Made in: China A message from the manufacturer: We recommend a coloured wax pencil or whiteboard marker only for writing on the clear window as permanent marker can be very difficult to remove. The volumes of the bulk food bags vary dependent on what you are putting in them. For example a small bag of flour is going to weigh more than a small bag of corn chips, but to give a rough idea we have modelled the look of our Bulk Food Bags on the classic 1kg and 2kg flour bags with the large being able to carry as much as 5kg. The goal for our reusable bulk bags is to be able help people easily and conveniently transport their bulk food purchases home. The bags have been designed as a lightweight top up tool to replace the need for carrying jars and canisters when doing your shopping, and when you bring them home you should empty the contents into your storage jars and containers. Although made from recycled plastic drink bottles and technically plastic, the rPET material that makes our bags is woven in nature not solid state plastic like a single use plastic bag which is non-permeable for air and water. Because of the woven nature of the fabric, a solid state plastic bag will definitely prevent air from reaching the bulk food products better than our bulk bags will when storing your bulk food products. Things like pasta hold well in them, but things that rely on freshness are better stored in an airtight container.

Onya’s large reusable bulk food bag provides a convenient alternative to taking jars or containers and they are also super handy for topping up half-filled containers at home as it means you don’t need any extra containers on top of your current ones.

The volumes of the bulk food bags vary dependent on what you are putting in them. For example a small bag of flour is going to weigh more than a small bag of corn chips, but to give a rough idea we have modelled the look of our Bulk Food Bags on the classic 1kg and 2kg flour bags with the large being able to carry as much as 5kg. The goal for our reusable bulk bags is to be able help people easily and conveniently transport their bulk food purchases home. The bags have been designed as a lightweight top up tool to replace the need for carrying jars and canisters when doing your shopping, and when you bring them home you should empty the contents into your storage jars and containers. Although made from recycled plastic drink bottles and technically plastic, the rPET material that makes our bags is woven in nature not solid state plastic like a single use plastic bag which is non-permeable for air and water. Because of the woven nature of the fabric, a solid state plastic bag will definitely prevent air from reaching the bulk food products better than our bulk bags will when storing your bulk food products. Things like pasta hold well in them, but things that rely on freshness are better stored in an airtight container. Our bulk bags are definitely at their best when used to carry home your bulk food dry goods and transfer the contents into your bulk food storage jars and containers to ensure freshness.",In stock
