It lasts MANY months even with our heavy use throughout the day. We use it extensively, at least 10 times per day, seven days a week. Our zero-waste vegan DISH BLOCK ® dishwashing soap is a cleaning powerhouse with a rich, sudsy lather. Cuts stubborn grime and grease on dishes, pots and pans. With added aloe vera to be gentle on your hands. You can even use it for cleaning-duty all over your home. Take stains out of laundry, take labels off of jars, spot clean your carpet, use it to wipe down counters... it's a truly multipurpose product. The HUGE 21.5 oz bar is great for intense industrial use, like in a pottery studio, mechanic shop, or daycare center. We have been using ours for months at the studio sink and it's about halfway used. For one person at home, it can last up to 9-18 months. For a household of two people, it can last up to 4.5-9 months. For larger households, it will typically be used at a faster rate. Recommended: Pair with a Moso Bamboo Soap Shelf to keep it drained and dry between uses. Use with the Casa Agave™ dish brush, long handle , or pot scrubber , or coconut husk multipurpose dish brushes . How to use: Scrape dishes to remove excess grease and food. Wet sponge, for plates, bowls and cups, and rub dish block® bar to create suds. (Repeat as needed to refresh suds.) Wash items and rinse well. Works in warm or cold water. We prefer warm water for best results. For pots and pans, use a scrubber or scourer. For extra sparkly dishes: wipe dishes dry with a cloth. Pro kitchen tip: Use the same DISH BLOCK® suds to clean your sink when it gets dirty, this can be used on porcelain, stainless, stone and glass sinks safely. We have seen customers use it to clean dirty & stained oven top surfaces as well! Please note: using a strong scourer exclusively on the soap will wear it down faster than using a soft sponge. Contains: One 21.5 oz DISH BLOCK ® bar. (Due to the handmade and hand cut nature of this product, there will be imperfections, chips, cracks, fissures and roughness on the bar and rough variations on the surface, this is normal.)

This scrub brush is made from bamboo with bass fibre bristles. A zero waste product. Replaces: plastic scrub brushes. Designed for cleaning both your veggies as well as your pots and pans. Can be used on non-stick pans, just be more gentle with it. Longevity: Each brush can be used for 1-3 months or longer. Do not leave any of the wood parts soaking in water, the wood will absorb water and it will cause the wood to swell and crack. Hang to dry or place in a dry spot after using it. If you find your brush is not staying dry, dip the bristles in vinegar occasionally to help kill bacteria. The bamboo is naturally antibacterial but the vinegar will help too. Continue using this brush until the bristles no longer work, then compost or bury in garden or dispose in a green waste bin. Stop using the brush and replace it if you see any mould growth. Storage and Care: To reduce cracking, keep the wood parts dry and do not soak or submerge them in water. You can oil your brushes to reduce the potential of cracking if you regularly submerge your dish brushes in water. Using with the No Tox Life Dish Block®: Keep in mind that when using the No Tox Life Dish Block®, a soft sponge on most dishes is ideal for best longevity. If you use a hard bristle brush on all dishes, you will wear down the Dish Block® faster than a sponge and might dig a hole in the middle of the block. End of life: Once worn out, the wood and plant fiber parts can be composted or buried in the garden. Why it matters: Plastic bristle scrub brushes shed tiny pieces of plastic called micro plastics. Unfortunately these tiny plastic pieces are not filtered out fully by sewage treatment. So when you hear about the ""Great Pacific Garbage Patch"" the majority of this garbage patch in the Pacific Ocean is actually tiny pieces of plastic that aren't even visible to the human eye. These tiny plastic pieces are being eaten by marine animals and ending up in the food chain, being consumed by humans in sushi restaurants around the globe! And if you're vegan, they are ending up in our tap water too. Help us turn off the plastic tap and choose a more sustainable option for humans and the planet. Sustainability: Bamboo, known as the giant bamboo or timber bamboo, has been used for centuries to fashion buildings, flooring and culinary tools. The young shoots are often prepared into Asian dishes. It is a fast-growing grass and we use the species of plant that is not eaten by giant pandas. "" Great quality, sells itself !""

They are often called 'soapnuts', but they are not nuts at all. They are in fact a fruit! 500g will result in 180+ washes! Soapberries are the fruit of the Sapindus Mukorossi tree, which grows in several different regions around the world, but is most prevalent in the Himalayas. The shell of the fruit is then collected, dried and packed for use. The shell is exceptionally high in 'saponin' which is nature's soap. This saponin content reduces the surface tension of the water so it will remove dirt and leave fabrics, soft and clean. That Red House Soapberries are harvested from wild trees in the pristine Himalayan mountains of Nepal, by small local communities. By purchasing this product, you are supporting the ' Grow Nepal ' initiative which creates a future for the Nepalese people, and encourages sustainable practices across the planet. No pesticides, fertilisers or chemical treatments have been used in the growing or storing process. This ensures that nothing but 100% natural organic products are used in your home. Why are soapberries so fantastic Easy to use and reusable Soapberries (also known as soap nuts) are a natural alternative to traditional laundry detergents and soap. Hypo-allergenic. Perfect for those with allergies or sensitive skin. Money saving. Soapberries cost around 10c per wash load for a 1kg bag. Compared to conventional washing powders, they can save you a great deal over the course of a year Harsh chemical free, grey water safe, septic safe and fully compostable. Soapberries are 100% sustainable, and their use ensures that deforestation is reduced in the Himalayas. Soapberries eliminate the need for fabric softeners as they leave clothes feeling soft and fresh. Our 'That Red House' soapberries are also certified organic by international certification body Ecocert and USDA. Soapberries can be used in any area of the home. They can be used as laundry detergent, shampoo, hand wash, household cleaner, body wash and have many more applications. Anti-bacterial and anti-fungal. Not tested on animals. Odourless. Perfect for babies and children as they are extremely gentle yet effective. Reduces pollution. Soapberry trees are often subject to deforestation, so purchasing them ensures that they are maintained as a form of income for the Nepalese people, thus reducing deforestation. 100% Australian owned company. Nothing is more precious than your health and the health of your family. Conventional soaps and detergents contain a veritable cocktail of chemicals, capable of causing untold health problems now and into the future. "" I love soap berries.

Goods That Give,Deodorant (Earl Grey) - Extra Strength Odor Control - Zero Waste (unpackaged large cube),19.95,https://goodsthatgive.com.au/products/copy-of-dish-block®-zero-waste-dish-washing-bar-free-of-dyes-and-fragrance,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0267/3000/4564/products/deodorant_7.jpg?v=1591700633,Deodorant,"Earl Grey (Bergamot Italian Orange) with a hint of herb garden make a pleasant, light fragrance. Unisex. Our extra-strength aluminum-free and paraben-free vegan deodorants are designed to keep you fresh with a very light application. Since they only need one light swipe per armpit, they last much longer than ordinary deodorants. Zero Waste Large Cube (no packaging or holder - store in airtight container otherwise it will get dry and hard to apply over time) | 100 grams (3.5 oz) | can last up to 6 to 12 months with regular use How it works: We use enzymes to help zap the odour-causing bacteria, and bamboo extract to help absorb excess wetness. Each puck or cube will glide on lightly and smoothly. New extra strength formula: This concentrated deodorant is strong and effective. Use only one light swipe per armpit. Transition period from aluminum deodorant: Aluminum based antiperspirants include big brand products, as well as alternative products like crystal sticks, alum sticks and mineral salt sticks. When switching away from these, you might experience a detox effect for a few days to a couple weeks. What we mean by detoxing is: you may be more stinky and sweaty at first while your body is ridding itself of the buildup that has accumulated with antiperspirant use. Antiperspirants block the pores so sweat (and toxins) can’t get out. Your body needs to sweat to remove waste. Re-apply as needed: You may want to reapply during the first few weeks until the detoxing is finished. To reapply, first wipe the area dry, then just use one light swipe to refresh your protection. After the detox period, the deodorant should last 8 hours without need to reapply. "" The best natural deodorant I’ve ever used. I really enjoyed the smell and the way it applies on the pits. I have very sensitive armpits and have been trying different sorts of “natural” deodorants, but this one has been the best! I will continue to get my supplies here :)"" Jasmine If you shave, wax or epilate, or for sensitive skin: As with any deodorant, we do not recommend applying directly after shaving or hair removal, and we recommend using an extra layer of cream or moisturizer (a small bit of shea butter works great) first if the skin is particularly sensitive and prone to irritation. Apply the moisturizer or oil or butter first then apply the deodorant. What to do if it dries out: Each deodorant is handmade with vegan ingredients, in small batches. Since there is a high amount of aloe vera juice, it may evaporate over time and the stick will become drier, and glide less. This doesn't mean it's no longer working - it still will work and be effective. You can re-hydrate it by spritzing with water or using a wet finger to get the “slippery” feeling again. Store in airtight container: For the unpackaged deodorants, keep it in an airtight container to prevent the aloe vera juice from evaporating. This is especially a factor in dry climates. High heat: Keep your deodorant out of direct heat or sun (for example your car in the summer) because your deodorant could melt at very high temperatures. "" It really works! I was so sure it was just going to be another natural deodorant that didn't work, but I thought, I'd give it a try since the reviews were so good. And to much to my surprise it actually works!! I was shocked. And it smells great! This plus the pit detox bar! Do it. You won't be disappointed.""

Goods That Give,No Tox Life Casa Agave™ Dish Brush - Long Handle,10.95,https://goodsthatgive.com.au/products/casa-agave™-dish-brush-long-handle,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0267/3000/4564/products/dish_brush_0.jpg?v=1591184169,Dish brush,"No Tox Life Casa Agave Dish Brush This eco-friendly dish brush has a white teakwood handle and brush head, with stiff agave fiber (vegan) plant bristles. It is held together with silver metal wire, and includes a small wire loop at the end for hanging dry. Replaces: plastic handled dish brushes. Can be used to wash general dishes as well as to loosen stuck on food. If you find your brush head is not staying dry, dip the bristles in vinegar occasionally to help kill bacteria. The white teakwood is naturally antibacterial but the vinegar will help too. Continue using this brush until the bristles no longer work or the brush head falls apart, then compost or bury in garden or dispose in a green waste bin. Stop using the brush and replace it if you see any mold growth. Storage and Care: To reduce cracking, keep the wood parts dry and do not soak or submerge them in water. Cracking is normal for uncoated brushes if you tend to get the wooden parts very wet. You can oil your brushes to reduce the potential of cracking if you regularly submerge your dish brushes in water. End of life: Once worn out, t he wood and agave parts can be composted or buried in the garden, the silver metal parts can be recycled. Why it matters: Plastic bristle brushes shed tiny pieces of plastic called micro plastics. Unfortunately these tiny plastic pieces are not filtered out fully by sewage treatment. So when you hear about the ""Great Pacific Garbage Patch"" the majority of this garbage patch in the Pacific Ocean is actually tiny pieces of plastic that aren't even visible to the human eye. These tiny plastic pieces are being eaten by marine animals and ending up in the food chain, being consumed by humans in sushi restaurants around the globe! And if you're vegan, they are ending up in our tap water too. Help us turn off the plastic tap and choose a more sustainable option for humans and the planet. Sustainability: For the wood handle, we do not use the species Teak that is endangered, we use a different species called White Teak wood that is very fast-growing (similar to bamboo) and even considered a weed in some countries because it grows so fast. Agave Fiber: Casa Agave™ agave fiber bristles are grown, harvested, sun-dried and processed in Mexico using traditional techniques to ensure a high quality and strong natural fiber. "" Dish brush. I recently purchased the long handled dish brush and a dish washing block. It’s working great and really allows the soap to get sudsy while cleaning dishes.

Includes: Frizz Wrangler : For those of you who abuse your hair with hot irons, curlers, hair dryers or bleach, Frizz Wrangler is for you. Supremely smoothing without weighing your hair down making your hair silky smooth and easy to style. As usual samoan coconut and cocoa butter make an appearance, along with a host of other divine ingredients. Best in tandem with our solid conditioner, The Guardian (also included). Heali Kiwi: The Heali Kiwi! Specifically for those who suffer from scalp problems, this bar is chock full of kiwifruit oil, coconut oil, neem oil, oats and karanja oil. Great for grumpy, sensitive scalps. Saint Clements: If you struggle with oily hair then Saint Clements is for you. There are no harsh 'stripping' surfactants (foaming agents) which just create more oil, nor is there any silicone. We use lime & orange oils to balance oil production, clean the scalp and freshen your hair up. Leaves your hair perfect without the need for a conditioner as there are humectants in there which draw moisture to your hair, without the oil. Perfect! The Guardian: The Guardian was created for those people who suffer from very dry, very damaged or frizzy hair. Containing lots of cocoa butter, coconut oil, vitamin B5 and zesty lime oil, it will tame your frizz, hydrate dry hair and make your hair look smooth and lush (it won't repair your hair, it is impossible to repair something that is dead.) The Guardian can also be used as a shaving bar or an in-shower moisturiser. Wonderbar: As the name would suggest our Wonderbar is truly wonderful. A solid conditioner bar that doubles as a shaving bar and an in-shower moisturiser for those with sensitive skin. Coconut oil alongside cocoa butter and Vitamin B5 make this super effective. Each sample weighs between 10-20g giving you ample chance to try each product. The samples come in a chocolate box style package, which is 100% compostable.
