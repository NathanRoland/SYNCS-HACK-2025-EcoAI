It lasts MANY months even with our heavy use throughout the day. We use it extensively, at least 10 times per day, seven days a week. Our zero-waste vegan DISH BLOCK ® dishwashing soap is a cleaning powerhouse with a rich, sudsy lather. Cuts stubborn grime and grease on dishes, pots and pans. With added aloe vera to be gentle on your hands. You can even use it for cleaning-duty all over your home. Take stains out of laundry, take labels off of jars, spot clean your carpet, use it to wipe down counters... it's a truly multipurpose product. The HUGE 21.5 oz bar is great for intense industrial use, like in a pottery studio, mechanic shop, or daycare center. We have been using ours for months at the studio sink and it's about halfway used. For one person at home, it can last up to 9-18 months. For a household of two people, it can last up to 4.5-9 months. For larger households, it will typically be used at a faster rate. Recommended: Pair with a Moso Bamboo Soap Shelf to keep it drained and dry between uses. Use with the Casa Agave™ dish brush, long handle , or pot scrubber , or coconut husk multipurpose dish brushes . How to use: Scrape dishes to remove excess grease and food. Wet sponge, for plates, bowls and cups, and rub dish block® bar to create suds. (Repeat as needed to refresh suds.) Wash items and rinse well. Works in warm or cold water. We prefer warm water for best results. For pots and pans, use a scrubber or scourer. For extra sparkly dishes: wipe dishes dry with a cloth. Pro kitchen tip: Use the same DISH BLOCK® suds to clean your sink when it gets dirty, this can be used on porcelain, stainless, stone and glass sinks safely. We have seen customers use it to clean dirty & stained oven top surfaces as well! Please note: using a strong scourer exclusively on the soap will wear it down faster than using a soft sponge. Contains: One 21.5 oz DISH BLOCK ® bar. (Due to the handmade and hand cut nature of this product, there will be imperfections, chips, cracks, fissures and roughness on the bar and rough variations on the surface, this is normal.)

This scrub brush is made from bamboo with bass fibre bristles. A zero waste product. Replaces: plastic scrub brushes. Designed for cleaning both your veggies as well as your pots and pans. Can be used on non-stick pans, just be more gentle with it. Longevity: Each brush can be used for 1-3 months or longer. Do not leave any of the wood parts soaking in water, the wood will absorb water and it will cause the wood to swell and crack. Hang to dry or place in a dry spot after using it. If you find your brush is not staying dry, dip the bristles in vinegar occasionally to help kill bacteria. The bamboo is naturally antibacterial but the vinegar will help too. Continue using this brush until the bristles no longer work, then compost or bury in garden or dispose in a green waste bin. Stop using the brush and replace it if you see any mould growth. Storage and Care: To reduce cracking, keep the wood parts dry and do not soak or submerge them in water. You can oil your brushes to reduce the potential of cracking if you regularly submerge your dish brushes in water. Using with the No Tox Life Dish Block®: Keep in mind that when using the No Tox Life Dish Block®, a soft sponge on most dishes is ideal for best longevity. If you use a hard bristle brush on all dishes, you will wear down the Dish Block® faster than a sponge and might dig a hole in the middle of the block. End of life: Once worn out, the wood and plant fiber parts can be composted or buried in the garden. Why it matters: Plastic bristle scrub brushes shed tiny pieces of plastic called micro plastics. Unfortunately these tiny plastic pieces are not filtered out fully by sewage treatment. So when you hear about the ""Great Pacific Garbage Patch"" the majority of this garbage patch in the Pacific Ocean is actually tiny pieces of plastic that aren't even visible to the human eye. These tiny plastic pieces are being eaten by marine animals and ending up in the food chain, being consumed by humans in sushi restaurants around the globe! And if you're vegan, they are ending up in our tap water too. Help us turn off the plastic tap and choose a more sustainable option for humans and the planet. Sustainability: Bamboo, known as the giant bamboo or timber bamboo, has been used for centuries to fashion buildings, flooring and culinary tools. The young shoots are often prepared into Asian dishes. It is a fast-growing grass and we use the species of plant that is not eaten by giant pandas. "" Great quality, sells itself !""

They are often called 'soapnuts', but they are not nuts at all. They are in fact a fruit! 500g will result in 180+ washes! Soapberries are the fruit of the Sapindus Mukorossi tree, which grows in several different regions around the world, but is most prevalent in the Himalayas. The shell of the fruit is then collected, dried and packed for use. The shell is exceptionally high in 'saponin' which is nature's soap. This saponin content reduces the surface tension of the water so it will remove dirt and leave fabrics, soft and clean. That Red House Soapberries are harvested from wild trees in the pristine Himalayan mountains of Nepal, by small local communities. By purchasing this product, you are supporting the ' Grow Nepal ' initiative which creates a future for the Nepalese people, and encourages sustainable practices across the planet. No pesticides, fertilisers or chemical treatments have been used in the growing or storing process. This ensures that nothing but 100% natural organic products are used in your home. Why are soapberries so fantastic Easy to use and reusable Soapberries (also known as soap nuts) are a natural alternative to traditional laundry detergents and soap. Hypo-allergenic. Perfect for those with allergies or sensitive skin. Money saving. Soapberries cost around 10c per wash load for a 1kg bag. Compared to conventional washing powders, they can save you a great deal over the course of a year Harsh chemical free, grey water safe, septic safe and fully compostable. Soapberries are 100% sustainable, and their use ensures that deforestation is reduced in the Himalayas. Soapberries eliminate the need for fabric softeners as they leave clothes feeling soft and fresh. Our 'That Red House' soapberries are also certified organic by international certification body Ecocert and USDA. Soapberries can be used in any area of the home. They can be used as laundry detergent, shampoo, hand wash, household cleaner, body wash and have many more applications. Anti-bacterial and anti-fungal. Not tested on animals. Odourless. Perfect for babies and children as they are extremely gentle yet effective. Reduces pollution. Soapberry trees are often subject to deforestation, so purchasing them ensures that they are maintained as a form of income for the Nepalese people, thus reducing deforestation. 100% Australian owned company. Nothing is more precious than your health and the health of your family. Conventional soaps and detergents contain a veritable cocktail of chemicals, capable of causing untold health problems now and into the future. "" I love soap berries.

Goods That Give,Deodorant (Earl Grey) - Extra Strength Odor Control - Zero Waste (unpackaged large cube),19.95,https://goodsthatgive.com.au/products/copy-of-dish-block®-zero-waste-dish-washing-bar-free-of-dyes-and-fragrance,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0267/3000/4564/products/deodorant_7.jpg?v=1591700633,Deodorant,"Earl Grey (Bergamot Italian Orange) with a hint of herb garden make a pleasant, light fragrance. Unisex. Our extra-strength aluminum-free and paraben-free vegan deodorants are designed to keep you fresh with a very light application. Since they only need one light swipe per armpit, they last much longer than ordinary deodorants. Zero Waste Large Cube (no packaging or holder - store in airtight container otherwise it will get dry and hard to apply over time) | 100 grams (3.5 oz) | can last up to 6 to 12 months with regular use How it works: We use enzymes to help zap the odour-causing bacteria, and bamboo extract to help absorb excess wetness. Each puck or cube will glide on lightly and smoothly. New extra strength formula: This concentrated deodorant is strong and effective. Use only one light swipe per armpit. Transition period from aluminum deodorant: Aluminum based antiperspirants include big brand products, as well as alternative products like crystal sticks, alum sticks and mineral salt sticks. When switching away from these, you might experience a detox effect for a few days to a couple weeks. What we mean by detoxing is: you may be more stinky and sweaty at first while your body is ridding itself of the buildup that has accumulated with antiperspirant use. Antiperspirants block the pores so sweat (and toxins) can’t get out. Your body needs to sweat to remove waste. Re-apply as needed: You may want to reapply during the first few weeks until the detoxing is finished. To reapply, first wipe the area dry, then just use one light swipe to refresh your protection. After the detox period, the deodorant should last 8 hours without need to reapply. "" The best natural deodorant I’ve ever used. I really enjoyed the smell and the way it applies on the pits. I have very sensitive armpits and have been trying different sorts of “natural” deodorants, but this one has been the best! I will continue to get my supplies here :)"" Jasmine If you shave, wax or epilate, or for sensitive skin: As with any deodorant, we do not recommend applying directly after shaving or hair removal, and we recommend using an extra layer of cream or moisturizer (a small bit of shea butter works great) first if the skin is particularly sensitive and prone to irritation. Apply the moisturizer or oil or butter first then apply the deodorant. What to do if it dries out: Each deodorant is handmade with vegan ingredients, in small batches. Since there is a high amount of aloe vera juice, it may evaporate over time and the stick will become drier, and glide less. This doesn't mean it's no longer working - it still will work and be effective. You can re-hydrate it by spritzing with water or using a wet finger to get the “slippery” feeling again. Store in airtight container: For the unpackaged deodorants, keep it in an airtight container to prevent the aloe vera juice from evaporating. This is especially a factor in dry climates. High heat: Keep your deodorant out of direct heat or sun (for example your car in the summer) because your deodorant could melt at very high temperatures. "" It really works! I was so sure it was just going to be another natural deodorant that didn't work, but I thought, I'd give it a try since the reviews were so good. And to much to my surprise it actually works!! I was shocked. And it smells great! This plus the pit detox bar! Do it. You won't be disappointed.""

Goods That Give,No Tox Life Casa Agave™ Dish Brush - Long Handle,10.95,https://goodsthatgive.com.au/products/casa-agave™-dish-brush-long-handle,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0267/3000/4564/products/dish_brush_0.jpg?v=1591184169,Dish brush,"No Tox Life Casa Agave Dish Brush This eco-friendly dish brush has a white teakwood handle and brush head, with stiff agave fiber (vegan) plant bristles. It is held together with silver metal wire, and includes a small wire loop at the end for hanging dry. Replaces: plastic handled dish brushes. Can be used to wash general dishes as well as to loosen stuck on food. If you find your brush head is not staying dry, dip the bristles in vinegar occasionally to help kill bacteria. The white teakwood is naturally antibacterial but the vinegar will help too. Continue using this brush until the bristles no longer work or the brush head falls apart, then compost or bury in garden or dispose in a green waste bin. Stop using the brush and replace it if you see any mold growth. Storage and Care: To reduce cracking, keep the wood parts dry and do not soak or submerge them in water. Cracking is normal for uncoated brushes if you tend to get the wooden parts very wet. You can oil your brushes to reduce the potential of cracking if you regularly submerge your dish brushes in water. End of life: Once worn out, t he wood and agave parts can be composted or buried in the garden, the silver metal parts can be recycled. Why it matters: Plastic bristle brushes shed tiny pieces of plastic called micro plastics. Unfortunately these tiny plastic pieces are not filtered out fully by sewage treatment. So when you hear about the ""Great Pacific Garbage Patch"" the majority of this garbage patch in the Pacific Ocean is actually tiny pieces of plastic that aren't even visible to the human eye. These tiny plastic pieces are being eaten by marine animals and ending up in the food chain, being consumed by humans in sushi restaurants around the globe! And if you're vegan, they are ending up in our tap water too. Help us turn off the plastic tap and choose a more sustainable option for humans and the planet. Sustainability: For the wood handle, we do not use the species Teak that is endangered, we use a different species called White Teak wood that is very fast-growing (similar to bamboo) and even considered a weed in some countries because it grows so fast. Agave Fiber: Casa Agave™ agave fiber bristles are grown, harvested, sun-dried and processed in Mexico using traditional techniques to ensure a high quality and strong natural fiber. "" Dish brush. I recently purchased the long handled dish brush and a dish washing block. It’s working great and really allows the soap to get sudsy while cleaning dishes.

Includes: Frizz Wrangler : For those of you who abuse your hair with hot irons, curlers, hair dryers or bleach, Frizz Wrangler is for you. Supremely smoothing without weighing your hair down making your hair silky smooth and easy to style. As usual samoan coconut and cocoa butter make an appearance, along with a host of other divine ingredients. Best in tandem with our solid conditioner, The Guardian (also included). Heali Kiwi: The Heali Kiwi! Specifically for those who suffer from scalp problems, this bar is chock full of kiwifruit oil, coconut oil, neem oil, oats and karanja oil. Great for grumpy, sensitive scalps. Saint Clements: If you struggle with oily hair then Saint Clements is for you. There are no harsh 'stripping' surfactants (foaming agents) which just create more oil, nor is there any silicone. We use lime & orange oils to balance oil production, clean the scalp and freshen your hair up. Leaves your hair perfect without the need for a conditioner as there are humectants in there which draw moisture to your hair, without the oil. Perfect! The Guardian: The Guardian was created for those people who suffer from very dry, very damaged or frizzy hair. Containing lots of cocoa butter, coconut oil, vitamin B5 and zesty lime oil, it will tame your frizz, hydrate dry hair and make your hair look smooth and lush (it won't repair your hair, it is impossible to repair something that is dead.) The Guardian can also be used as a shaving bar or an in-shower moisturiser. Wonderbar: As the name would suggest our Wonderbar is truly wonderful. A solid conditioner bar that doubles as a shaving bar and an in-shower moisturiser for those with sensitive skin. Coconut oil alongside cocoa butter and Vitamin B5 make this super effective.

"" Delighted that this came in a glass jar, it's now the second jar I've purchased. I've had no issues at all, I do only use it in the shower however as the charcoal can be a bit messy to clean up in the sink. It's fantastic and super easy to use in the jar ."" Chris "" Finally a zero-waste toothpaste! It took a little getting used to, but very happy with the clean you get. Love the little jar it comes in which I know I'll be able to re-purpose.

The natural toothpaste won’t not go bad, but it may dry out if left out for an extended period.

Start by adding only a few drops and continue to add small amounts until your preferred toothpaste consistency has been reached. Be sure to place the metal lid back on the glass jar, this should prevent the toothpaste from drying out. Is Nelson Naturals Toothpaste suitable for sensitive teeth?

Using toothpaste packaged in a glass jar is a slightly different procedure than using your standard tubed version. The key: dip, brush, rinse and smile! The best way to use Nelson Naturals glass jar toothpaste is to simple dip your brush into the jar — unlike your standard toothpaste, you don’t need to apply as much to the brush. A little goes a long way! If the thought of putting your brush back into the jar is unappealing, you can opt to use a wooden applicator to dip and spread the paste onto your toothbrush.

It is estimated that we release approximately 4kg of microplastics per person per year into the environment via various means. Every time synthetic clothes are washed, countless microfibers are released into the water and make their way into rivers, lakes, and oceans. Once in the environment, they are consumed by aquatic organisms, which can result in gastrointestinal infections and blockages, reproductive problems, and starvation. The tiny plastic fragments threaten our own health too as they enter our diet and our bodies through the food chain. Alarmingly, microplastics are thought to be present in virtually everything we consume. They’ve been detected in human placentas, our bloodstream and our organs. With the GUPPYFRIEND Washing Bag, you can help prevent the release of microplastics into our waterways. The Guppyfriend reduces fibres shedding during washing thereby protecting your clothes, and it reliably filters microplastic fibres out before they pollute water. Why have we selected this product?

That’s why I use it for shoo! as it will be gentle on those who suffer from eczema, psoriasis, and other inflammatory skin problems or sensitive skin.

In the US alone, it has been estimated that more than two billion razor blade heads are thrown into landfill each year. And that stat doesn’t even include the plastic disposable razors. Shaving cartridges are made of a mix of rubber and plastic (some even contain palm oil in the moisturizing strips) making them impossible to recycle and therefore destined for landfill. Don’t forget about the plastic trays they all come packaged in as well. However, you can now put your worries aside as there is an amazing and far less wasteful alternative available here at Little Eco Shop. Introducing these beautifully sleek, modern and durable reusable safety razors from Kappi. Guaranteed to reduce your environmental footprint and provide the smoothest, irritation-free shave of your life. Why have we selected this product? Includes one reusable razor plus 5 replacement blades (approx. 35 shaves) Choice of 3 stunning colours: matte gold, matte rose gold and matte black The most stunning safety razor on the market Unisex razor Blades can be recycled at end of their life 100% plastic-free Enjoy a smooth and irritation-free shave – no more unsightly ingrowns Economical in the long run (see below for more info) Additional blades can be purchased at Little Eco Shop Product Stats: Material: Stainless steel Dimensions / weight: 10.5 cm L Made in: China A few messages from the manufacturer: Included with every razor is a 5-pack of replacement razor blades which should last around 35 shaves (5-7 shaves per blade). Safety Razor vs. Modern Razor - A cost comparison. The cost of our safety razors is truly a reflection of their quality. The genius of modern day shaving companies is that they make a loss on the shaver handle and make a HUGE profit on the replacement blades. So while modern razors blades seem cheap by comparison, over time they end up costing you big time. Compared to modern multi-blade cartridge heads costing around $3 per head, the Kappi safety razor uses traditional double-sided razor blades that only cost around 20-cents - around 15 times cheaper than the modern equivalent. How to use your new Safety Razor: Unpack your safety razor. With dry hands, hold onto either side of the razor head and unscrew the handle anti-clockwise to loosen. The base will disconnect from the head. Once the razor is disassembled, carefully unwrap the blade and place it onto the head of the razor. After the blade is in place, reassemble the razor by screwing the handle clockwise to tighten. Get shaving! For a smooth shave, we recommend soaking your skin with warm water, using a shave cream/gel/oil (or bar of soap) and take it slow! Be especially careful when shaving around ankles, knees etc. Use your razor on an angle (different for different areas) and apply very little to zero pressure. Once the blade begins to dull, replace your blade and put your used blade in a glass jar to store and eventually recycle."

What is the best way to wash cloth wipes? We suggest to follow the Clean Cloth Nappies guidelines for an effective wash routine. Why are white wipes recommended for nappy change time? White wipes are recommended because you can wash them at a higher temperature and not worry about colour reduction. While the coloured wipes are extremely durable, they may fade over time if washed repeatable on a hot wash."

Where do you start if you want to reduce the plastic in your life? Especially when most of us are wearing it, eating and drinking from it, sitting on it, walking on it, and probably even ingesting it. Anywhere you go, plastic is within easy reach - even in Antarctica and the North Pole. We didn't quit plastic overnight. In fact, it's still a work in progress. But along the way, we have learnt a lot by researching the issue from the grass roots up, speaking to people, and finding out what works and what doesn't. We answer the tricky questions, like 'How will I wash my hair?', 'Do I have to give up crackers?', 'What about my bin liner?' and 'Is this going to be expensive?' As we continue to remove throw-away plastics from our daily lives, we've discovered we're friendlier with our local communities, we're eating healthier food, and de-cluttering happens by itself.

No more need for disposable nail files or chemical filled nail polishes. And best of all these Buff Wands can be used over and over again. Simply wash the glass wand with soapy water and it’s as good as new! See you in the buff!! Why have we selected this product? Replaces regular nail file, cuticle pusher, nail buffer and clear polish Eco-friendly – glass lasts longer than traditional emery board which is made of plastic and sandpaper (which wear down quickly) or metal (which corrode and rust) Will last years if cared for correctly Tempered glass is better for nail health - traditional emery boards and metal files damage the surface and edges of your nails, opening them up to bacteria and fungus and making them weak. Glass files seal the surface and edges which help to prevent chipping and strengthen nails. Traditional nail files are meant to be disposed of and replaced every 3 months as they cannot be cleaned or sanitised so they collect a buildup of bacteria which can cause infections, weakness and breakage. Not the Buff Wand though! Reusable – simply wash in soapy water and your Buff Wand is as good as new Product Stats: Material: Tempered glass nail file packaged in plastic carry case for protection Dimensions / weight: Made in: China"

Sunprints were originally developed as a learning tool by educators at the Lawrence Hall of Science at the University of California. They are perfect for curious kids looking to experiment with some sun-based science or for any age wanting to get in touch with their artistic side. Whether you want to add to your craft equipment, create some artistic pieces for your home or encourage some scientific based learning, Sunprints are the thing for you. They make excellent gifts and in turn can be used to create artistic gifts perfect for doting relatives. They truly are the gift that keeps on giving! How it works: Get your kids (or adults!) to hunt or forage for some fun and interesting shaped objects such as a fern, flower or feather Arrange your objects on a piece of Sunprint paper out of the reach of the sun. Place the acrylic pressing sheet on top to flatten and hold your items to the Sunprint paper Take your Sunprint outside and lay it in direct sunlight for 2-5 minutes. Rinse your Sunprint in water. Watch the white turn into blue and the blue turn into white. To get the deepest blue that the paper can give, leave it in the water for a while: 1-5 minutes. Lay your Sunprint flat on an absorbent surface and allow it to dry. You can use a paper towel or a piece of cardboard as a bed for your Sunprint while it dries. Putting it on something absorbent will help to avoid the formation of water spots by drawing the water away from the Sunprint paper. Admire your beautiful, deep blue Sunprint!

Every year 14,000 tonnes of sunscreens wash off bathers into our oceans. Science now knows that many of the chemicals present in traditional sunscreens directly impact ocean health.

And now you can get all the benefits of Sunbutter's natural, plastic-free, reef-safe sunscreen but with natural sunkissed glow included.

Find tips, strategies, recipes, and DIY projects for reducing waste in this approachable, beautifully designed and illustrated guide. What is zero waste living? Although the practice has been around for generations out of necessity, it is making a comeback as concerns grow about the fate of our environment. To put it simply: it is attempting to send no waste to landfills. Although you may have read or heard about “zero waste,” “sustainable,” or “green” living, the concept can sometimes seem too complicated, the author’s tone a bit self-righteous, or riddled with advice geared for people with 5 acres of land in the country with dreams of raising livestock and homesteading. This is not that book. Can a “regular” person do this? Absolutely! Zero waste isn’t necessarily about zero, but more about changing or altering the way we see the world around us, how we consume, and how we think about waste. It’s about making better choices when we can, and working to reduce our overall impact by reducing the amount of packaging and single-use plastics we bring into our life. An Almost Zero Waste Life will change the way you see the world around you, how you consume, and how you think about waste for a healthier planet and happier you. Why have we selected this product? Focusing on the positive, An Almost Zero Waste Life presents simple ways to reduce waste in every aspect of your life: Cleaning: Recipes for natural cleaners and how to ditch paper towels for good. Meal plans: Weekly menus and recipes for zero waste meals that use bulk pantry staples. Shopping: How to shop zero waste at big chain stores and ways to reduce food packaging. Bathroom: Sustainable beauty routine. Recycling: Ingenious ways to repurpose old clothing and how to recycle small metals, like razor blades. Compost: The basics of composting. And much more.

The OrganiCup reusable menstrual cup provides you with an eco-friendly and economical alternative which is safe, easy to use and reliable. Popularity in the menstrual cup has been growing considerably over recent years. A study conducted on menstrual cup users showed that 91% of participants said they would continue to use a menstrual cup after using it for 3 cycles and said they would recommend it to others. Why have we selected this product?

Every beginning can be difficult – including trying a menstrual cup for the first time. However we can assure you, there’s nothing to fear. Here are five simple steps on how to use a menstrual cup: Sterilize the cup Before the first use, sterilize the cup in boiling water for 3-5 minutes. Fold and insert the folded cup There are many ways to fold the cup, we recommend the Punch Down fold and the C-fold. Once the entire cup is inside of you, simply let it pop open. Check if the cup is unfolded Reach in and feel around the base of the cup – it should feel round or oval and not have any noticeable folds. If you feel any dents, gently grip the base of the cup (not the stem) and rotate it to make it unfold. Remove the menstrual cup Pull slightly on the stem while using your abdominal muscles to push the OrganiCup downwards until you can reach the base. Give the base of the cup a pinch to release the suction and ease it out. Avoid removing your menstrual cup by pulling the stem as this might cause discomfort. Empty and re-insert. It may take you a few days or a few periods to become comfortable with the cup. Experiment with different folding and insertion techniques – and don’t worry, you’ll soon become a dedicated cup convert! Which size menstrual cup is right for you? We’re all built differently – luckily – and that’s why we offer three sizes OrganiCup. We have chosen to distinguish between the two in the following way: Mini – recommended for teens or those who need a smaller size Size A – recommended for those who have not given birth vaginally Size B – recommended for those who have given birth vaginally Some find this overly generalized; some even find it offensive. That’s completely understandable, but as the vagina is 100% unique to the individual, it will never be a ‘one size fits all’ product. You might not notice a difference after having given birth vaginally, but things have changed and your vagina will probably not return completely to its pre-birth shape and that is completely fine! Therefore, we have chosen pre- and post vaginal birth as the primary factor when guiding our customers. We wish to keep it easy for our customers to choose and our research shows it is a physiological factor one needs to consider and that vaginal birth is actually the most decisive factor when you’re choosing cup size. Factors to consider when choosing the right cup size With that said, it doesn’t mean that one who has given birth vaginally can’t use a Size A and that a young user, who hasn’t given birth vaginally, with a heavier flow can’t use a Size B. We do offer a size guarantee, if the size against expectation should be wrong. In fact, most people can use either size OrganiCup and our guideline is not bullet proof so there are a couple of other factors, you might want to consider when you’re choosing the menstrual cup size for you. Regular or heavy flow The OrganiCup can be used for up to 12 hours at the time – also during night – depending on your flow. We recommend that you empty your menstrual cup more frequently in the beginning while you’re getting to know the cup and your flow. If you have a light or regular flow, we recommend the Size A or Size Mini for teens or those who need a smaller size. However, if you have a heavier flow you might want to consider going with the Size B, which has a bigger capacity. Some OrganiCup users like to have both cup sizes, as their flow is heavier in the beginning of their menstrual cycle and therefore prefer the Size B and then switch to the Size A in the end of their cycle where their flow is lighter. First time cup users We recommend the Size Mini or Size A for teens and young cup users. You can actually start using a menstrual cup as soon as you get your period. Although, there is no age limit; it does however require that you are comfortable with your body and period. Mums For the mums, we generally recommend going with a Size B as per the above, however, have you delivered your child/children by C-section, we recommend going with an OrganiCup Size A."

Onya’s reusable bulk food bags provide a convenient alternative to taking jars or containers.

The volumes of the bulk food bags vary dependent on what you are putting in them. For example a small bag of flour is going to weigh more than a small bag of corn chips, but to give a rough idea we have modelled the look of our Bulk Food Bags on the classic 1kg and 2kg flour bags with the large being able to carry as much as 5kg. The goal for our reusable bulk bags is to be able help people easily and conveniently transport their bulk food purchases home. The bags have been designed as a lightweight top up tool to replace the need for carrying jars and canisters when doing your shopping, and when you bring them home you should empty the contents into your storage jars and containers. Although made from recycled plastic drink bottles and technically plastic, the rPET material that makes our bags is woven in nature not solid state plastic like a single use plastic bag which is non-permeable for air and water. Because of the woven nature of the fabric, a solid state plastic bag will definitely prevent air from reaching the bulk food products better than our bulk bags will when storing your bulk food products. Things like pasta hold well in them, but things that rely on freshness are better stored in an airtight container. Our bulk bags are definitely at their best when used to carry home your bulk food dry goods and transfer the contents into your bulk food storage jars and containers to ensure freshness."

Although made from recycled plastic drink bottles and technically plastic, the rPET material that makes our bags is woven in nature not solid state plastic like a single use plastic bread bag which is non-permeable for air and water. Because of the woven nature of the fabric, a solid state plastic bag will definitely prevent air from reaching the loaf better than our bread bags will when storing your bread on the bench top, which is why we mention that bread will only really last 2-3 days on the bench top, and will likely only be suitable for toast after the first 24hrs. As mentioned above however, our bags are Freezer Proof and store your bread really well when frozen from fresh for up to 3 months without freezer burn in a frost free freezer. Using our lunch wraps or even beeswax wraps to wrap around the end of the bread being cut helps cut down on the exposure to air for the bread, but it is important that the bag can breathe too. Again fresh bread from a bakers, which are often preservative free, will only last 2-3 days on the bench top anyway. It is best to freeze sliced bread from fresh if you want your bread to last a week or two. Our bread bags are definitely at their best when used to not only collect your bread from the baker, but also for storing your fresh bakery or home baked sliced bread in the freezer."

Onya’s small reusable bulk food bag provides a convenient alternative to taking jars or containers and they are also super handy for topping up half-filled containers at home as it means you don’t need any extra containers on top of your current ones. Why have we selected this product? Made from 4 BPA free food safe 100% recycled plastic drink bottles 100% recyclable Clear window allows you to see inside and to write product name or code Tare weight is included on the bag 100% vegan friendly 12 month manufacturer’s warranty Product Stats: Material: rPET – made from 4 recycled plastic drink bottles Dimensions / weight: 27cm L x 11cm W with 6.5cm gusset Made in: China A message from the manufacturer: We recommend a coloured wax pencil or whiteboard marker only for writing on the clear window as permanent marker can be very difficult to remove. The volumes of the bulk food bags vary dependent on what you are putting in them. For example a small bag of flour is going to weigh more than a small bag of corn chips, but to give a rough idea we have modelled the look of our Bulk Food Bags on the classic 1kg and 2kg flour bags with the large being able to carry as much as 5kg. The goal for our reusable bulk bags is to be able help people easily and conveniently transport their bulk food purchases home. The bags have been designed as a lightweight top up tool to replace the need for carrying jars and canisters when doing your shopping, and when you bring them home you should empty the contents into your storage jars and containers. Although made from recycled plastic drink bottles and technically plastic, the rPET material that makes our bags is woven in nature not solid state plastic like a single use plastic bag which is non-permeable for air and water. Because of the woven nature of the fabric, a solid state plastic bag will definitely prevent air from reaching the bulk food products better than our bulk bags will when storing your bulk food products. Things like pasta hold well in them, but things that rely on freshness are better stored in an airtight container. Our bulk bags are definitely at their best when used to carry home your bulk food dry goods and transfer the contents into your bulk food storage jars and containers to ensure freshness."

Onya’s large reusable bulk food bag provides a convenient alternative to taking jars or containers and they are also super handy for topping up half-filled containers at home as it means you don’t need any extra containers on top of your current ones. Why have we selected this product? Made from 4 BPA free food safe 100% recycled plastic drink bottles 100% recyclable Clear window allows you to see inside and to write product name or code Tare weight is included on the bag 100% vegan friendly 12 month manufacturer’s warranty Product Stats: Material: rPET – made from 4 recycled plastic drink bottles Dimensions / weight: 40cm L x 21cm W with 10.5cm gusset Made in: China A message from the manufacturer: We recommend a coloured wax pencil or whiteboard marker only for writing on the clear window as permanent marker can be very difficult to remove. The volumes of the bulk food bags vary dependent on what you are putting in them. For example a small bag of flour is going to weigh more than a small bag of corn chips, but to give a rough idea we have modelled the look of our Bulk Food Bags on the classic 1kg and 2kg flour bags with the large being able to carry as much as 5kg. The goal for our reusable bulk bags is to be able help people easily and conveniently transport their bulk food purchases home. The bags have been designed as a lightweight top up tool to replace the need for carrying jars and canisters when doing your shopping, and when you bring them home you should empty the contents into your storage jars and containers. Although made from recycled plastic drink bottles and technically plastic, the rPET material that makes our bags is woven in nature not solid state plastic like a single use plastic bag which is non-permeable for air and water. Because of the woven nature of the fabric, a solid state plastic bag will definitely prevent air from reaching the bulk food products better than our bulk bags will when storing your bulk food products. Things like pasta hold well in them, but things that rely on freshness are better stored in an airtight container. Our bulk bags are definitely at their best when used to carry home your bulk food dry goods and transfer the contents into your bulk food storage jars and containers to ensure freshness."

About the Artwork When Ngurunderi travelled through what is now Ngarrindjeri country he came down the Murray River in his canoe. At that time it was just a small stream. Ngurunderi was looking for his two wives who had run away from him and was following Pondi, the big Murray Cod who had created the twists and turns of the river when sweeping his huge tail from side to side. Ngurunderi was trying to spear Pondi all the way along the journey. Together they formed the Murray River, lakes and landforms and everything in Ngarrindjeri Country. Ngurunderi made the rain that feeds the river and the country. With the rain came the rainbow, which can be seen in this painting. Ngurunderi also made the Ngarrindjeri people, who live along and around the River Murray, lakes, the Coorong region and across to Cape Jervis and the southern regions of what is now Adelaide. Ngurunderi travelled with his family and they also played a part in the creation of Ngarrindjeri country. Ngurunderi taught everyone the lore, dance, song, how to hunt and live and everything they needed to survive in their country. When they reached Lake Alexandrina Nepele, Ngurunderi’s brother in law, helped spear and kill Pondi. Ngurunderi cut Pondi into many pieces, each piece creating a new species of fish that now populates the river system. Ngurunderi never did catch his wives who drowned when crossing to Kangaroo Island, which was still joined to the mainland at that time. At this point Ngurunderi joined the spirit world becoming a star in the Milky Way. About the Producers: Better World Arts"

Read more about Better World Arts here . About the Artwork 'Two Dogs Dreaming' by Murdie Nampijinpa Morris In this Dreaming story, two dog ancestors, a Jampijinpa and a Napangardi, travelled from the west to the east. At Tapu (a rockhole), the two dogs separated. The female dog, Napangardi, went to the south. The male dog, Jampijinpa, went to the north. Eventually he became lonely and howled for Napangardi in the south. She came running to him, and they married each other at Ngarnka. They wore men’s and women’s marriage headdresses, and Jampijinpa painted himself with white clay for the ceremony. The two dogs continued running east, before arriving in Warlaku (Ali Curung). Many other dogs were living in Warlaku when they arrived. There were many families of dogs, mothers and fathers and children and uncles all living together. Jampijinpa and Napangardi made a burrow to rest in and started a big family of dogs there. They chose to stay in Warlaku and live with all the other dogs. In this way, the ‘malikijarra Jukurrpa’ (two dogs Dreaming) tells the story of proper conduct in families and marriages."

The old woman then proceeded to shape four islands, including Darwin, Bathurst, and Melville Island.

Following this, she crafted the islands while carrying her children on her back.

At that time it was just a small stream. Ngurunderi was looking for his two wives who had run away from him and was following Pondi, the big Murray Cod who had created the twists and turns of the river when sweeping his huge tail from side to side. Ngurunderi was trying to spear Pondi all the way along the journey. Together they formed the Murray River, lakes and landforms and everything in Ngarrindjeri Country. Ngurunderi made the rain that feeds the river and the country. With the rain came the rainbow, which can be seen in this painting. Ngurunderi also made the Ngarrindjeri people, who live along and around the River Murray, lakes, the Coorong region and across to Cape Jervis and the southern regions of what is now Adelaide. Ngurunderi travelled with his family and they also played a part in the creation of Ngarrindjeri country. Ngurunderi taught everyone the lore, dance, song, how to hunt and live and everything they needed to survive in their country. When they reached Lake Alexandrina Nepele, Ngurunderi's brother in law, helped spear and kill Pondi. Ngurunderi cut Pondi into many pieces, each piece creating a new species of fish that now populates the river system. Ngurunderi never did catch his wives who drowned when crossing to Kangaroo Island, which was still joined to the mainland at that time. At this point Ngurunderi joined the spirit world becoming a star in the Milky Way.

Wood essential oils are generally thicker than other essential oils. You may notice more residue after use in your diffuser than normal. This is not a sign of impurities, rather a difference in characteristics between plants, often between leaf and wood of the same plant. We recommend cleaning your diffuser after each use to avoid any residue build up. The quickest and easiest way to do this is by dipping a cotton tip in pure white vinegar or rubbing alcohol and wiping the inside of your diffuser. Be sure to get into the edges and corners. Take extra care when moving near or over the plate. About the Makers Native Secrets Native Secrets is an Indigenous-owned business, founded by husband and wife team Cherie and Phil.

When you see the hills from a distance, the wind blows through the sand, making the hills move and change form. The wind makes ripples, undulations and ridges in the sand in the same shapes and patterns that can be seen in this painting. These sandhills are a common sight around Papunya - some of the hills are so large they can only be walked across. In between the sandhills are dry claypans and rockholes.

He remembers spending much of his childhood travelling in the surrounding country of this region. Otto finished high school in Yuendumu and has continued his studies through the indigenous college in Alice Spring where he got a bachelor in Business. He has worked for Yuendumu Council and the Tanami Goldmine in the 1990s. Otto paints his father's, Paddy Japaljarri Sims, stories, that were passed down to Paddy by his parents, and their parents before them for millennia. These stories relate directly to Otto's country at Kunajarrayi and Yanjilpirri, its features and flora and fauna. Otto has painted for Warlukurlangu Artists Aboriginal Corporation, an Aboriginal owned and governed art centre located in Yuendumu, since 1990, and was elected to its executive committee in 2002 and Chairman of the art centre in 2007. In March 2008 Otto travelled to Bahrain for the opening of a Warlukurlangu group exhibition at the La Fontaine Centre of Contemporary Art. This was Otto's first trip overseas. Otto has a passion for hunting Kiparra (Bush turkey), and can often be seen driving down backroads around Yuendumu in his four wheel drive.

This bag makes a fantastic gift. 35 x 40cm Fully lined Two leather handles Zipped interior pocket The artist receives royalties for their artwork﻿ About the Artwork Janganpa Jukurrpa (common brush-tail possum Dreaming) travels all over Warlpiri country. ‘Janganpa’ are nocturnal animals that often nest in the hollows of white gum trees (‘wapunungka’). This story comes from a big hill called Mawurrji, west of Yuendumu and north of Pikilyi (Vaughan Springs). A group of ‘janganpa’ ancestors resided there. Every night they would go out in search of food. Their hunting trips took them to Wirlki and Wanapirdi, where they found ‘pamapardu’ (flying ants). They journeyed on to Ngarlkirdipini looking for water. A Nampijinpa women was living at Mawurrji with her two daughters. She gave her daughters in marriage to a Jupurrurla ‘janganpa’ but later decided to run away with them. The Jupurrurla angrily pursued the woman. He tracked them to Mawurrji where he killed them with a stone axe. Their bodies are now rocks at this place. Warlpiri people perform a young men’s initiation ceremony, which involves the Janganpa Jukurrpa. The Janganpa Jukurrpa belongs to Jakamarra/Jupurrurla men and Nakamarra/Napurrurla women. In Warlpiri paintings traditional iconography is used to represent this Jukurrpa. ‘Janganpa’ tracks are often represented as ‘E’ shaped figures and concentric circles are used to depict the trees in which the ‘janganpa’ live, and also the sites at Mawurrji.

When you are totally hot and sweaty, blood pumping, and your natural cleansing systems are fully activated. Lavender acts as a natural antiseptic and calms the skin. Inhale the perfume of the creamy bubbles to refresh the senses! This blend is also effective for acne-prone skin. Use it on a soft cotton face washer to gently cleanse your face once or twice a week. No plastic bottles! Great for your skin & for the environment! How to use: For the creamiest lather be sure to use a sponge or loofah with your soap. Once or twice a week grab the bar in hand and directly wash all over with it! Thoroughly rinse skin and pat dry. Be sure to leave your bar well drained between use to extend its life.

If your item is heavily soiled, you can rinse with lukewarm water but never fully submerge the product as this may cause irreversible damage. 2 Let your item dry before any application is made and refrain from using a heat source to dry more quickly, as this could cause damage. 3 We recommend using a natural colourless wax for your #MadeFromPiñatex products. Apply a small amount to a dry, soft cloth and rub sparingly over the textile in a circular motion until fully absorbed. Do not use too much wax as it may not fully absorb. 4 Leave your item to dry naturally for 24 hours after application. 5 You can also buff the wax off with a dry cloth or soft brush.

Check. Dirty face? Hell no! A powdered cleanse with potent actives to help improve skin tone, remove dead skin cells, while magically balancing, brightening, and moisturizing skin. Enzymes Help to gently peel dead skin cells, improving skin tone and appearance. Skin type Uneven skin tone, oily, combination, and acne-prone skin. A gentle powder-to-foamy cleanser with natural enzymes from pineapple and Aussie native wild child Pepperberry to help improve skin tone and remove dead skin cells while magically balancing, brightening, and moisturizing skin. Just add water! The Cleanse Dust vegan enzyme powder face cleanser is the MVP of your daily skincare routine. A waterless formula packed with nutrients from shiitake mushroom, Aussie grown Banana, and Pepperberry leaves skin balanced and brighter every day. Its powder form allows you to control the exact type of lather you’d like by adjusting the amount of water added. So those natural enzymes? We thought you’d ask… Pineapple’s active ingredient, bromelain, is an enzyme wizard, helping to reignite cellular turnover and even out your skin tone. Mix in banana, rich in potassium and zinc, to make one helluva fruit salad and keep your complexion healthy AF, all while cleansing, hydrating, purifying, and restoring balance. Why’s it so special? A waterless formula means all its active ingredients remain potent and undiluted. Pepperberry has a long history of medicinal use in Aboriginal culture because of its ridiculously high amounts of antioxidants, vitamins E & A, and rutin; all mega-forces that stimulate collagen production and help soothe, brighten and preserve skin. Cleanse Dust gets a little help from kaolin to detoxify, while banana hydrates, so your skin isn't stripped of its much-needed natural moisture. Tips? For the perfect lather, adjust the amount of Cleanse Dust and water while rubbing your hands together. If you are sensitive to pineapple this product may not be suitable for you. How to use it Shake out a small coin-sized amount of powder into your wet palm and rub your hands together to create a creamy lather. Massage in a circular motion into your face and then rinse off with warm water. Frequency For daily use, morning and night. How much A small pea-size amount.

We recommend caring lovingly for your product. / 1 Clean your product thoroughly and effectively using a cloth soaked in warm soapy water. If your item is heavily soiled, you can rinse with lukewarm water but never fully submerge the product as this may cause irreversible damage. / 2 Let your item dry before any application is made and refrain from using a heat source to dry more quickly, as this could cause damage. / 3 We recommend using a natural colourless wax for your #MadeFromPiñatex products. Apply a small amount to a dry, soft cloth and rub sparingly over the textile in a circular motion until fully absorbed. Do not use too much wax as it may not fully absorb. / 4 Leave your item to dry naturally for 24 hours after application. / 5 You can also buff the wax off with a dry cloth or soft brush.

They’re snacks and treats which are good for you! They are also super convenient, and easy to make. We’ve done the hard work for you. Have some packs in the pantry so you always have what you need on hand to create delicious, nutritious snacks the whole family will enjoy! Here at Adventure Snacks we’re working towards a world where convenient, nutritious food is easily available to everyone. We use high quality organic and natural ingredients to create great tasting products without the junk, and believe this will help inspire our kids to have a life-long love of real food. We only use the types of things you might find in a kitchen cupboard. Nothing strange which sounds like it comes from a laboratory rather than a kitchen, like unnecessary additives and preservatives. And we strive to challenge industry standards. If we can make something tasty that is also good for our bodies, why wouldn’t we? Our kids deserve the best. Apart from making delicious organic snacks, we also aim to inspire and educate both parents and children to make better, more informed food choices. We don’t like misleading packaging, or marketing messages ourselves, so promise to always have clear, honest labelling so you know what is in the food. Isn’t that the way it should be anyway? We want to be part of the change; the movement towards holding big companies responsible and calling them out on their deceitful ways. We’d love for you to join us! We choose to use organic ingredients where possible – not only are they free from synthetic chemicals and pesticides (and higher in nutrition), but organic farming is also better for our environment. The choices we, as a business make, impact the world around us so we want to ensure the impact is a positive one!"
